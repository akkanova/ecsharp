## Introduction ##

LeMP is an open-source LISP-style macro processor for C#, comparable to [sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org/) for Javascript. Install it in Visual Studio to help you write boilerplate.

LeMP helps you solve the **repetition-of-boilerplate** problem, and it allows you to transform code at compile-time in arbitrary ways. For example, the biggest macro that comes packaged with LeMP is a parser generator called LLLPG. This example defines `EmailAddress.Parse()`, which parses an email address into `UserName` and `Domain` parts:

~~~csharp
#importMacros(Loyc.LLPG);

struct EmailAddress
{
   public EmailAddress(public UString UserName, public UString Domain) {}
   public override string ToString() { return UserName + "@" + Domain; }

   LLLPG (lexer(inputSource: src, inputClass: LexerSource)) {
      // LexerSource provides the runtime APIs that LLLPG uses. This is
      // static to avoid reallocating the helper object for each address.
      [ThreadStatic] static LexerSource<UString> src;
   
      public static rule EmailAddress Parse(UString email) @{
         {
            if (src == null)
               src = new LexerSource<UString>(email, "", 0, false);
            else
               src.Reset(email, "", 0, false);
         }
         UsernameChars ('.' UsernameChars)*
         { int at = src.InputPosition; }
         '@' DomainCharSeq ('.' DomainCharSeq)* EOF
         {
            UString userName = email.Substring(0, at);
            UString domain = email.Substring(at + 1);
            return new EmailAddress(userName, domain);
         }
      }
      static rule UsernameChars() @{
         ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9'|'!'|'#'|'$'|'%'|'&'|'\''|
         '*'|'+'|'/'|'='|'?'|'^'|'_'|'`'|'{'|'|'|'}'|'~'|'-')+
      };
      static rule DomainCharSeq() @{
               ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9')
         [ '-'? ('a'..'z'|'A'..'Z'|'0'..'9') ]*
      };
   }
}

### Example: using ###

A really simple example is 'using' statements:

~~~csharp
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using Loyc.Collections;
using Loyc.MiniTest;
using Loyc.Syntax;
~~~

Luckily, Visual Studio can add these for us. But wouldn't it be nice if half the screen wasn't 'using' statements every time you open a file? There is a LeMP macro that lets you collapse these onto a couple of lines:

~~~csharp
using System(.Linq, .Text, .Collections(, .Generic), .IO, );
using Loyc(.Collections, .MiniTest, .Syntax);
~~~

The comma `,` before the closing `)` adds an "empty" parameter to the list, which indicates that `using System` itself is one of the outputs you want to produce.

### Example: Null checking ###

As long as there is no such thing as [non-](https://gist.github.com/olmobrutall/31d2abafe0b21b017d56)[nullable reference types](http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post330_non-nullable-types-vs-c-fixing-the-billion-dollar-mistake), we'll be checking if our method parameters are `null`, and if we're extra careful, we might check our return value, too. This can be done in the traditional way,

~~~csharp
static string Twice(string s)
{
	if (s != null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException("s");
	return s + s;
}
~~~ 

Or in the new way, using Microsoft Code Contracts:

~~~csharp
static string Twice(string s)
{
	Contract.Requires(s != null)
	return s + s;
}
~~~ 

But with LeMP, it's a one-liner:

~~~csharp
static string Twice(notnull string s) => s + s;
~~~ 

Your output file will say

~~~csharp
static string Twice(string s)
{
	Contract.Assert(s != null, "Precondition failed: s != null")
	return s + s;
}
~~~ 

**Note**: This feature does _not_ require the MS Code Contracts rewriter to be installed in Visual Studio, since LeMP has a built-in "rewriter" of its own, and it relies on `Contract.Assert`, one of the only methods of the `Contracts` class that does not require the rewriter. This behavior is customizable, e.g. LeMP can be told to use the standard methods instead, such as `Contract.Requires` and `Contract.Ãˆnsures`.)

The `notnull` attribute can be applied to the return value, as well, to check at run-time that a method does not return null. However, `notnull` is not supported on ordinary variables. LeMP also includes other "code contract" attributes. For example, the `notnull` modifier actually equivalent to either `[requires(# != null)]` or `[ensures(# != null)]`, depending on whether you use it on an argument or return value, respectively. The hash sign `#` represents the value of the current parameter, or return value, depending on where you have used the contract attribute.

### Example: Small data types ###

I like to create a lot of small data types, rather than using a few huge ones. And when you're making small data types, C# is annoying. A simple type isn't hard:

~~~csharp
public class Person {
	public string Name;
	public DateTime DateOfBirth;
	public List<Person> Children;
};
~~~

But this simplicity has a big price:

- There's no constructor, so you must always use property-initializer syntax to create one of these. That could get old fast. And if you ever _add_ a constructor later, you might have to change every place where you created one of those types.
- Since there's no constructor, you can't easily validate that valid values are used for the fields, and none of your fields have mandatory initialization.
- Many of the best developers say you should make your fields read-only if possible. And the style police say you should make them properties instead of fields.

So, you probably need a constructor. But adding a constructor is a pain!

~~~csharp
public class Person
{
	public string Name           { get; private set; }
	public DateTime DateOfBirth  { get; private set; }
	public List<Person> Children { get; private set; }
	public Person(string name, DateTime dateOfBirth, List<Person> children)
	{ 
		Name = name;
		DateOfBirth = dateOfBirth;
		Children = children;
		// TODO: Add validation code
	}
}
~~~

It's too much repetition!

- You repeat the class name twice.
- You repeat each data type twice.
- You repeat each property name twice.
- You repeat the name of each constructor parameter twice.
- You repeat "public" for each field (and more, if they are properties)

LeMP solves these problems with a combination of (1) a macro, and (2) a little syntactical "makeover" of C#. In LeMP you'd write this:

~~~csharp
public class Person
{
	public this(
		public string Name           { get; private set; },
		public DateTime DateOfBirth  { get; private set; },
		public List<Person> Children { get; private set; })
	{
		// TODO: Add validation code
	}
}
~~~

Your output file will contain exactly the code listed above, and there is no repetition except for `public .. { get; private set; }` (but you might not want everything to be a public property anyway, and if you're using C# 6.0 / VS2015 you can drop the `private set` part). Great! 

What's going on? Enhanced C# includes two syntax changes to support this, each with a supporting macro:

1. To reduce repetition and ambiguity, Enhanced C# allows `this` as a constructor name (a feature borrowed from the [D language](http://dlang.org)). A macro changes `this` into `Person` so that plain C# understands it.
2. Enhanced C# allows property definitions as method parameters (or wherever an expression is allowed). A macro is programmed to notice properties, and visibility attributes (like `public`) on variables. When it notices one of those, it responds by transferring it out to the class, and putting a normal argument in the constructor. Finally, it adds a statement at the beginning of the constructor, to assign the value of the argument to the property or field.
