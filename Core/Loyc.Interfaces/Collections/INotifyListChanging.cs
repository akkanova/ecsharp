	/// Encapsulates the <see cref="ListChanging"/> event that notifies listeners

	/// <typeparam name="T">Type of items in the list</typeparam>
	/// <typeparam name="TCollection">Type of the first argument of the event</typeparam>
	/// <remarks>
	/// This approach to change notification is more lightweight than the standard
	/// <see cref="INotifyCollectionChanged"/> interface because that interface
	/// sends both a list of new items and a list of old items, so many changes
	/// require a pair of temporary objects to be created that hold the two lists
	/// of items.
	/// <para/>
	/// In contrast, the <see cref="ListChanging"/> event includes only one list 
	/// that specifies the set of new items. In the case of Remove events, no change
	/// list is included. Since the collection has not been modified yet, the user
	/// handling the event can examine the list to learn which item(s) are being
	/// removed; if the list is being changed, it can similarly examine the list
	/// to see the old set of items.
	/// <para/>
	/// An optimization is available when only a single item is being added or
	/// changed. In that case, the collection class should create a lightweight 
	/// read-only single-item list by calling <see cref="ListExt.Single{T}(T)"/>.
	/// Such a list has less overhead than <see cref="List{T}"/> and the same
	/// overhead as an array of one item.
