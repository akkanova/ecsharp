	/// <summary>This interface is intended to be implemented by all Loyc collections 
	/// that implement <see cref="IList{T}"/>. It combines the original 
	/// <see cref="IList{T}"/> interface with its component interfaces 
	/// <see cref="IReadOnlyList{T}"/> and <see cref="IListSink{T}"/>, plus 
	/// a little bit of additional functionality in <see cref="IListSource{T}"/>.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Unfortunately, as far as the C# compiler is concerned, <see cref="IList{T}"/>
	/// and <see cref="IReadOnlyList{T}"/> are unrelated, which causes problems.
	/// <para/>
	/// This interface is not meant to be used as a variable type. It exists mainly 
	/// to avoid ambiguity errors when invoking overloaded methods in plain C#. For 
	/// example, there is a TryGet() extension method for IList{T} and an identical 
	/// TryGet() method for <see cref="IListSource{T}"/>. To prevent the C# compiler 
	/// from giving an ambiguity error when you try to call TryGet(), 
	/// <ul>
	/// <li>The list class must implement this interface (or <see cref="IListEx{T}"/> or
	///    <see cref="IListAndReadOnly{T}"/> or <see cref="IListAndListSource{T}"/>, and</li>
	/// <li>There must be a third version of TryGet() that accepts the interface that
	///     combines <see cref="IList{T}"/> with <see cref="IListSource{T}"/>, namely
	///     <see cref="IListAndListSource{T}"/> (if there is an overload that accepts
	///     IListImpl, it will of course eliminate the ambiguity error when called with
	///     a class that implements IListImpl, but not when called with a class that
	///     only implements IListAndListSource.)</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// Ironically, however, if you actually try to use the list through this 
	/// interface you'll tend to get errors. For instance, both <see cref="IList{T}"/>
	/// and <see cref="IReadOnlyList{T}"/> have an indexer, so using the indexer in
	/// this interface is ambiguous. Therefore, variables should not have this type 
	/// (except parameters to disambiguation methods, in which case the parameter is 
	/// immediately casted to another type).
