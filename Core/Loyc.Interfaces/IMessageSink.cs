	/// <summary>A general-purpose interface for a class that accepts formatted 
	/// messages with context information.</summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Helpful article: http://core.loyc.net/essentials/messagesink.html 
	/// <para/>
	/// IMessageSink is used for dependency injection of a target for formatted 
	/// messages; it could be used for log messages, compiler error messages, or
	/// to report the progress of a process, for instance. Frequently-used 
	/// message sinks include <see cref="ConsoleMessageSink.Value"/>, 
	/// <see cref="TraceMessageSink.Value"/>, and <see cref="MessageHolder"/>.
	/// <para/>
	/// It is typical to use <see cref="IMessageSink"/> without type parameters.
	/// <para/>
	/// Since .NET does not allow static members in an interface, the static
	/// members can be found in <see cref="MessageSink"/>.
	/// <para/>
	/// Each message has a <see cref="Severity"/>. For message sinks that are used 
	/// as loggers, this should be one of the following logging levels, listed
	/// in order of importance: Fatal, Error, Warning, Note, Debug, Verbose.
	/// <para/>
	/// For message sinks that are used for compiler messages, the standard
	/// levels are: Fatal, Error, Warning, Note, Detail. "Detail" provides more 
	/// information about a previously-printed message, while "Note" is intended 
	/// for independent messages that are less severe than warnings (e.g. lints).
	/// Some compilers may distiguish "soft" errors (which do not prevent the
	/// program from starting) from "critical" errors (which do). In that case, 
	/// Error may represent such a "soft" error and Critical may represent a
	/// "hard" error. Fatal, in contrast, represents an error that causes the
	/// compiler to halt immediately.
	/// <para/>
	/// If the message sink may produce messages that users will see, the message 
	/// sink itself should perform localization using <see 
	/// cref="Localize.Localized(string, object[])"/>.
	/// <para/>
	/// Only a single Write() method is truly needed (<see cref="Write(Severity, TContext, string, object[])"/>),
	/// but for efficiency reasons the interface contains two other writers. It 
	/// is expected to be fairly common that a message sink will drop some or
	/// all messages without printing them, e.g. if a message sink is used for 
	/// logging, verbose messages might be "off" by default. It would be 
	/// wasteful to actually localize and format a message if the message will
	/// not actually be printed, and it would also be wasteful to create an array 
	/// of objects to hold the arguments if they are just going to be discarded.
	/// With that in mind, since most formatting requests only need a couple of 
	/// arguments, there is an overload of Write() that accepts up to two
	/// arguments without the need to package them into an array, and there is
	/// an overload that takes no formatting arguments (this indicates that 
	/// parameter substitution is not required and should not be attempted.)
	/// <para/>
	/// In addition, the caller can call <see cref="IsEnabled(Severity)"/> to avoid 
	/// doing any work required to prepare a message for printing when a certain
	/// category of output is disabled.
	/// </remarks>
	/// <typeparam name="TContext">The type of the second parameer to <c>Write</c>, 
	/// which indicates where the error occurs. If the message relates to a text
	/// file or source code, the location is typically indicated with an object of
	/// type <see cref="Loyc.Syntax.ISourceRange"/> or <see cref="Loyc.Syntax.ILNode"/>.</typeparam>
