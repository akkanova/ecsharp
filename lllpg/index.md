LLLPG is a recursive-decent LL(k) parser generator for C# that integrates with Visual Studio and generates efficient code, similar to what you would write by hand. Parsers written with LLLPG include [Enhanced C#](https://github.com/loycnet/ecsharp/tree/master/Main/Ecs/Parser) and [LES](https://github.com/loycnet/ecsharp/tree/master/Core/Loyc.Syntax/LES). Help wanted to add additional output languages.

Download & install
------------------

LLLPG is distributed with LeMP and Enhanced C#; please see their [download & installation instructons](http://ecsharp.net/lemp/install.html). Also, please download the [Samples repository](http://github.com/qwertie/LLLPG-Samples) so you'll have some grammars to play with; these demos should compile successfully even before LLLPG is installed.
